### Environment Setup

Python version: **3.10**

Install required packages with:
Key packages used:  
`pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

---

### Data Description

- **Climate proxies**: Marine proxyâ€“based reconstructions (Marcott et al., 2013)  
- **Radiocarbon data**:  
  - Korea: AMS 14C dates (Seoul National University)  
  - Japan: National Museum of Japanese History  
- **Settlement proxy**: SPD_Z (normalized, smoothed time series)

---

### How to Reproduce

There are two options:

### Option 1: Notebook-based execution  
Open `analysis_cs.ipynb` and run all cells sequentially.

### Option 2: Script-based execution  
Run `analysis_cs.py` via terminal or IDE:

### Output Includes:

- Residual-based climate stress Z-scores  
- Normalized SPD_Z time series for Korea and Japan  
- Statistical analysis results (correlation, lag, Granger tests)  
- Reproducible figures (Figures 1â€“4 and S1â€“S12)  
- Excel tables with summary statistics and test results  

All outputs are saved in:  
- `output/figures/`  
- `output/tables/`

### Example Output
Figure 1. Observed Holocene temperatures (black dots) from MD01-2421 and KR02-06 cores with second-degree fit (grey line; RÂ² = 0.567).

### Notes

- Random seeds (e.g., `seed=42`) are fixed to ensure reproducibility.  
- SPD is binned at 20-year intervals; climate proxies use 60â€“100-year resolution.  
- This package reproduces all results reported in the manuscript submitted to *The Holocene*.
